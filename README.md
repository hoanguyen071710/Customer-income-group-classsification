#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
  In this notebook, we are going to predict whether a person's income is above 50k or below 50k using various features like age, education, and occupation.
  
  The dataset we are going to use is the Adult census income dataset from Kaggle which contains about 32561 rows and 15 features that can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income)
  
  The dataset contains the labels which we have to predict and the labels are discrete and binary. So the problem we have is a Supervised Classification type.
